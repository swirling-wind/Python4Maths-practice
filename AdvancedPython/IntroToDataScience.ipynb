    "## Scenario\n",
    "In this exerercise we are going to work through a fairly common scenario. After developing a couple of algorithms for solving a particular problem (or implementing some \"standard\" algorithms as well as your shiny new and hopefully improved algorithm), you test the algorithm on some instances and want to know which algorithm is \"best\"? Or which algorithm is best for what type of data? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to go through this type of analysis by focussing on alternative linear programming algorithms. So here are the elements that go into the analysis:\n",
    "* The problem to be solved:  $\\min c^T x$ subject to $A x = b,\\ x \\ge 0$ where $A$ is a $m\\times n$ matrix, $x$ is a vector of decision variables and $b$ and $c$ are appropriate constant vectors. In practice we normally allow some variants (for example inequality constraints, arbitrary lower and upper bounds on the variables). \n",
    "* Algorithms: Three standard algorithms, *primal* simplex, *dual* simplex, and the *barrier* method, as implemented by the CPLEX solver library\n",
    "* Instances: The [MIPLIB2010](http://miplib2010.zib.de/) \"standard\" test instances. The data sets are actually for mixed integer problems (where some variables are required to be binary or general integers), but for these tests we will throw away the binary requirements. There are 87 instances in this data set\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things easy you will not be required to re-run all of the tests but are given the results from running each algorithm on each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the data\n",
    "In an ideal world the data would already be sitting in a database or simple CSV file for you to read. However this may not always be possible. It is not uncommon for the data to be sitting in text files (perhaps the log files produced as the algorithms are run). Since such text files can get quite large, it makes sense to compress these. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task then is to obtain the data and display a few lines of one of the log files to see what these look like.\n",
    "That data can be found as a zip file at http://users.monash.edu/~andrease/Files/Other/cplexLP.zip. You could download this, unzip it and look at it - but we want to do things with python here. The basic library functions you need are\n",
    "* `urllib` using the `urllib.request.urlopen(\"name.of.url/to-load\")` function. Basic usage information is provided in this [how-to](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/urllib2.html?highlight=get%20url). It is probably easiest to just read this data and write it to file.\n",
    "* `zipfile` module provides methods for reading (and writing) zip archives. The basic usage is to create `zip=ZipFile(<file>,'r')` archive, then use `zip.namelist()` to inspect the contents and `zip.open(name,'r')` to open the named file. Complete documentation is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)\n",
    "* Note that all log files are ASCII. To convert a binary (ASCII) string to the standard python unicode string use `.decode(\"utf-8\")`"

The [regular expression documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) gives all the details, but to get you started the string `r\"^[abc]\\d*\"` would match any line that \n",
    "   * is at the start of a line (as incdicated by the `^`)\n",
    "   * has one of the characters in the set {'a','b','c'} (written as \"[abc]\") first\n",
    "   * is followed by zero or more digits \"\\d\" = digit, * means \"zero or more\", you could use \"+\" for \"one or more\"\n",
    "   * the string is written as a raw string (`r\"\"`) to make sure that \"\\\" is not interpreted as an escape character - since regular expressions make frequent use of the backslash\n",
    "   * it is also particularly useful and easy to mark a substring as a _group_. For example `r\"([xyz]+)\\1\"` means that we have a group consisting of one or more characters in {x,y,z} followed by the same group (group 1) repeating a second time. \n",
    "   * `import re` to get the library, then use `re.search(pattern,string)` to find a pattern in the given string, `re.search(pattern,string).group(1)` would give the substring of the first group in the time the pattern was matched (if the pattern was found at all).\n",

However so we can see more easily what is going on here, let's do it directly using the numpy matrix routines.\n",

For this you need `np.mean` which takes an argument `axis=d` to take the mean in the d'th dimension, and `X.T` is the transpose of numpy matrix `X`. Or just call `numpy.cov` - but be careful not to get features & observations (columns and rows) mixed up\n",

    "Pick an initial assignment of points to clusters (or an initial set of centres of the clusters)\n",
    "Repeat until converged:\n",

    "\n",
    "Some usuful numpy funtions\n",
    "* `np.random.randint(low,high,n)` returns array length n of integers in `range(low,high)`\n",
    "* `np.mean(matrix,axis=d)` = array of means (along either columns or rows depending on axis\n",
    "* `np.linalg.norm` = norm of an array\n",
    "* `np.argmin(matrix,axis=d)` = like mean iterates over elements along just one axis and returns the minimum index\n",
    "* `X[v > 0]` - returns a submatrix of X depending on which elements of `v` are positive. Whether `v` may be of length number of rows (to select whole rows) or same dimension as X (to select submatrix). Similarly `X[:,v>0]` would select submatrix based on columns where `v` is positive."

    "## Supervised Learning - Classification with Support Vector Machines\n",
    "We might want to figure out which algorithm works fastest for a given problem. That is, given a linear program and its characteristics, can we decide which algorithm to use to get the solution as fast as possible. Support vector machines are one model for such a classification task. It supposes that there is a _linear_ function of the factors that determines which of 2 classes a point belongs to. That is, that there exists a set of weights $w_i$ and constant $W$ such that\n",
    "$\\sum_i w_i f_i < W$ if one algorithm is faster and $\\sum_i w_i f_i > W$ when the other method is faster where $f_i$ are the features of the instance we are interested in solving. How do we decide what the $w_i$ (and $W$) should be? This is supervised learning where we are using existing _training data_ to fit the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by trying to work out for which instances the primal vs dual simplex method is faster. We have `primalT` and `dualT` that tells us which is faster for the test data. So we want to find a vector $w$ and constant $W$ such that\n",
    "$\\sum_i w_i f_{ki} \\le W-1$ if `PrimalT` < `DualT` and $\\sum_i w_i f_{ki} \\ge  W+1$ otherwise. (Where $f_{ki}$ is the i-th feature of instance k.  Finding such a set of $w_i$ and $W$ is just a linear programming problem. Some things we need to consider is: The limit of 1 is just to ensure we get some minimum separation (we could pick any number as multiplying each row by a constant would not change the problem other than to increase the non-zero difference between the LHS and W\n",
    "* If the instances can be separated, we want to make the 2 hyperplanes (defined by the $\\pm1$ on the right hand side) as far apart as possible(so that we get a clean separation). The separation distance is $2/||w||$. So maximising the separation is equivalent to $\\min ||w||^2$ which gives us a quadratic program with linear constraints.\n",
    "* It may not be possible to separate the points cleanly into two groups with a single hyperplane. Hence we might want to penalise any point that is mis-classified, perhaps based on how far it is away from the hyperplane. Let $v_k$ be the distance that point $k$ is away from the hyperplane then we might want to $\\min ||w||^2 + \\sum_k v_k$ with $\\sum_i w_i f_{ki} \\le W-1+v_k$,\n",
    "* We can put the two objectives together - by noting that maximisation is the same as minimising the negative and placing greater priority on minimising violations:\n",

Here $\\alpha$ is an arbitrary weight that provides a trade-off between violations (misclassifications) and the distance separating the hyperplanes.\n",
    "* Some variants of this are possible. For example we could replace the$||w||^2$ term by $\\max_i |w_i|$ (for example) which can be written in a linear program, or even drop it entirely. When there are violations these are minimised  if $||w||$ is minimised so we may not need this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence for an initial experiment we want to set up an SVM training function that takes our features as input data together with the list instances for which `data['PrimalT'] < data['dualT']` (this python expression returns a boolean column). Let `I` be those instances and `IC` be the complement. The we want to solve the following linear program:\n",
